# swyft-CMB

This repository allows one to reproduce computations presented in arXiv: xxxx.xxxx

Currently the code uses an old version of swyft, included as a submodule. In the near future, notebooks will be updated to use a more recent version of swyft (including parallel simulation and updated interface).

The main simulator relies on the publicly available Boltzmann code class https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/. See that repo for installation details.

We include as an example a small datastore with CMB power spectra.
